# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?.  If you skimp in this section expect to be marked down in your grade. Paint a picture of the project a couple of paragraphs is expected!-->

Is attitude toward capitol punishment (cappun) independent of race (race)?
If not, then whose view differs from whom??

# Methods

<!--Decide on your methods:  use "variable analysis" or other appropriate descriptors.  Make sure to choose at least one graphical method and at least one numerical method. Discuss what data manipulations may be needed for example subsetting or other binning procedures and what sort of graphical displays and inferential tools will be used!-->

This problem is a 'Categorical-Categorical' kind of problem, and when I looked into it, I found that there was a problem with the Category of race, there is a factor with 3 pieces to it - 'white,' 'black,' and 'others.' Capital punishment is a categorical level that only consists of two levels,
those in favor of 'capital punishment' and those 'opposed' to capital punishment. 

# Results

<!--Divide this section into two sub-sections:  One for your descriptive  results and one for your inferential results.!-->

## Descriptive Results

```{r}
dd3 <- mydata %>% group_by(cappun,race) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% mutate(prcnt=count/sum(count))


# the group_by followed by summarize(count=n())

basicC <- ggplot(dd3,aes(x=race,y=cappun,fill=cappun))
basicC + geom_bar(stat="identity",position="dodge")

#Now for percentage plot

basicCC <- ggplot(dd3,aes(x=race,y=prcnt*100,fill=cappun)) 
basicCC + geom_bar(stat="identity", position = "dodge")
```

### Graphical Descriptive Results

<!--Graphical results here.  Make sure to show your code.  Provide appropriate labels for axes, giving units if possible, and provide a good title for the graph, too.  Use the graphical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question. Bottom line is to explain the features of the graph that are relevant to conforming or departing to what is expected by your null hypothesis !-->





The 'white' and 'other' branch were in favor of 'Capital' punishment whilst the 'black' branch was opposed to it. When you combine the branches, it rounds up to exactly 100.

## Now with The Most data (fewer variables gives more data points)



### Numerical Descriptive Results

<!--Numerical results go here. Use the numerical results to describe the patterns if any that exist in the data as focused toward the research question!-->


Of the people from the numerical data, almost 80% of them were the 'white' individuals who were in favor of 'Capital punishment' Whilst 'black' individuals made up the 11.72%.
In the opposing side of capital punishment - there were 65.38% of 'white' individuals, and 24.11% 'black' individuals. 'Others' which were 10.51% were also opposed. 

## Now with More data

```{r}
fisherXY(mydata$race,mydata$cappun)
```

Statistically, every group is different from than every other group, each of the groups having a low P-value. 



## Inferential Results

<!--State hypothesis clearly.  Make sure your discussion of the inferential test covers all the aspects that the test output produces, such as test statistic, p-value etc.  Make a decision about the null hypothesis, explain the assumptions on which the selected test/procedure was based, and why the chosen procedure satisfys the assumptions and is appropriate to answer the research question!-->

The 'black' and 'white' individuals are the most different according to the P-Value. It has quite a low number, being 0.000017 - more 'white' individuals are for 'Capital' punishment whilst 'black' individuals are more against the 'Capital' punishment. However, for 'whites' and 'others,' the P-value is only 0.2565, which concludes that the difference between 'white' individuals and 'others' isn't as drastic, considering they both are for 'Capital' punishment.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If you found a relationship be sure to consider whether the relationship occurs because one of the variavbles causes the other, or whether they perhasps are related for some other reason.  Watch the chapter 6 videos from the GeorgeTown videos collection.!-->

Compared to the 'Number 2' branch, there are a significantly different amount of observations; concluded by the fact that there was only a detectable difference between the 'white' and black individuals, hence why there was not much of a difference in the P-Values. The evidence that proves so is the percentage we received by the 'Graphical Descriptive Results' - 'whites' having the percentage of 67.75% and 'black' individuals being 47.24%. And others having the value of 61.25%. 
'White' and 'other' individuals were those for 'Capital Punishment' and black individuals were opposed to it.
